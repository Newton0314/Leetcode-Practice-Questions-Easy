A machine product bolts of diameter D where D is normally distributed with mean 0.580 cm
and standard deviation of 0.015 cm. The machine is served and after the services a random sample of 50 bolts
was taken to see if the mean diameter change from 0.580cm. The distribution of the diameter 
after the service is still normal with a standard deviation of 0.015cm.
